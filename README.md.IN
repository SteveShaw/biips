The project has started on Dec. 2009 and is supported by the [ALEA team](http://alea.bordeaux.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux](http://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux).
Its main objective is to popularize the use of particle methods to researchers, practicians and students by developing a user-friendly software similar to [BUGS](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/)/[JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/).

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Biips_DESCRIPTION@

More context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bayesian inference consists in approximating an unknown parameter dependent conditional probability law given a set of observations. A large number of problems, e.g. non-supervised classification, filtering, etc., can be addressed having as basis the aforementioned formulation. The underlying probability law, while not calculable in analytical manner for the general case, can be approximated by using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods. These methods are popular for bayesian inference thanks to BUGS software and the WinBUGS graphical interface.

Emerged as a result of recent research studies, interacting particle based algorithms – a.k.a. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods in which the most common implementation is the particle filter – proved to have superior performances when compared to classical MCMC approaches. What is more, interacting particle algorithms are well adapted for dynamic estimation problems as encountered, for example, in filtering, tracking or classification problems. They do not require burn in convergence time and include calculation of the normalizing constant.

Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- BUGS language compatible
- Black-box inference engine with:
    - SMC/particle algorithms for filtering and smoothing
    - Static parameter estimation using particle MCMC
    - Automatic choice of the proposal samplers
- Core developped in C++
- R interface: Rbiips
- Matlab/Octave interface: Matbiips
- Easy language extensions with user-defined R and Matlab functions
- Multi-platform: Linux, Windows, Mac OSX
- Free and open source (GPL)

Roadmap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Optimization
- Parallelization
- Particle Gibbs algorithm

Getting Help
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The discusssion [forum](https://gforge.inria.fr/forum/?group_id=2515) can be used for any question or feedback about Biips.
This is the best place for getting help. All Biips users are invited to participate.

Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The core software libraries are written in C++.
An R package allows running Biips from the R statistical software and provides posterior analysis and plotting functions.
A Matlab toolbox provides similar capabilities.

The Biips source code is hosted on a git repository at GForge Inria. If you want to keep track of the development version, you can find downloading instructions on the [GForge Biips project](https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=2515).

  BiiPS is free software, licensed under the GPL.
  It borrows from the BUGS/JAGS software, widely used
  in Bayesian statistics, the statistical modeling
  with graphical models and the language associated
  with their descriptions. Both tools can be used
  by non-statisticians, via their automated "black
  box" inference engines. Unlike BUGS oriented
  MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo), BiiPS software is
  based on sequential Monte Carlo algorithms (SMC),
  also referred to as "interacting particles" or
  "particle filtering" and is thus more adapted to
  dynamic problems (tracking, signal filtering, etc).

The Rbiips package is an interface to the Biips libraries.  In order to
build a binary package, or install from source, you must have a matching
installation of the Biips librarie as well as Boost headers.

Windows
-------

At compile time, there is no way for windows to guess where the Biips and Boost
libraries are installed, so you must supply the location yourself using
the variables BIIPS_ROOT and BOOST_ROOOT.

You can specify BIIPS_ROOT and BOOST_ROOOT as environment variables, e.g.:

set BIIPS_ROOT=c:\Program Files\Biips\Biips-X.XX
set BOOST_ROOT=c:\Program Files\boost\boost-X.XX

where X.XX are the version numbers.

In R >= 2.12.0 you will be able to set BIIPS_ROOT and BOOST_ROOT as a (platform-
specific) make variable in etc${R_ARCH}/Makevars.win.

Unix
----

The configure script will try to guess the location of the Biips
libraries installation. It will look in /<prefix>/<lib>, where

- <prefix> is the determined from the location of the biips_info
  script.

  For example, if this is "/usr/local/bin/biips", then prefix will
  be "/usr/local"

- <lib> is derived from the value of "LIBnn", returned by 
  "R CMD config LIBnn".

  This is particularly important on 64-bit unix, where R is 
  installed by default in /usr/local/lib64 and LIBnn is "lib64"

The configure script will also look for Biips headers in
/<prefix>/include/biips

If the configure script fails to find the Biips headers or libraries,
you can set the environment variables BIIPS_INCLUDE and BIIPS_LIB
to point to the correct directory.

Alternatively, you can use the configure options

--with-biips-include=/path/to/biips/headers 
                    (default /usr/local/include/biips)

--with-biips-lib=/path/to/biips/libraries
                (default /usr/local/[lib|lib64])

These options are onto the Rbiips configure script with:
"R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-biips...'

#Exceptionally, you may need to set the location of the Biips modules.
#But this will only be necessary if you reset moddir when installing
#Biips. This can be done by setting the environment variable BIIPS_MODULES
#or by using the configure option
#
#--with-biips-modules=/path/to/biips/modules
#                    (default /usr/local/[lib|lib64]/biips/modules-w.y.z)
#                     where w.y.z is the version number of Biips

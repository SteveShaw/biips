\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

This report describes the technical aspects of the \biips{}\footnote{Bayesian inference with interacting Particle Systems} project including software design. It follows a previous functional specifications report \cite{biips_specifications_2010}, which only deals with \textbf{what} the software is expected to do, from the users point of view. In this report, we try to address the question: \textbf{how} it actually does it.

\paragraph{}
Chapter \ref{architecture} presents the development aspects including the software architecture, to understand what \biips{} software is composed of, and to understand the technical choices in terms of programming language and used libraries.

% \paragraph{}
% Chapter \ref{reference} is a short reference guide presenting the most important classes and design concepts of \biips Core library and the module \biips Base.

\paragraph{}
In chapter \ref{examples}, we present a simple example in order to understand how to write C++ code using \biips{} to instantiate a graphical model and run a SMC\footnote{Sequential Monte Carlo} algorithm.

\paragraph{}
Chapter \ref{developers} is a quick developers guide dealing with how to obtain the source code, compile and test \biips{} in a Linux environment. 

\paragraph{}
In chapter \ref{todo}, we sum up the remaining tasks, focusing on the BUGS language compiler.

Description: Biips is a general software for Bayesian inference with
    interacting particle systems, a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.
    It aims at popularizing the use of these methods to non-statistician
    researchers and students, thanks to its automated "black box" inference
    engine. It borrows from the BUGS/JAGS software, widely used in Bayesian
    statistics, the statistical modeling with graphical models and the language
    associated with their descriptions. Unlike MCMC methods used by BUGS/JAGS,
    SMC methods are more adapted to dynamic problems (tracking, signal
    filtering, etc).

 Biips is a general software for Bayesian inference with interacting particle systems, a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.
 It aims at popularizing the use of these methods to non-statistician researchers and students, thanks to its automated "black box" inference engine.
 It borrows from the BUGS/JAGS software, widely used in Bayesian statistics, the statistical modeling with graphical models and the language associated with their descriptions.
 Unlike MCMC methods used by BUGS/JAGS, SMC methods are more adapted to dynamic problems (tracking, signal filtering, etc).

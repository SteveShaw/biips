	abstract = {{WinBUGS} is a fully extensible modular framework for constructing and analysing Bayesian full probability models. Models may be specified either textually via the {BUGS} language or pictorially using a graphical interface called {DoodleBUGS.} {WinBUGS} processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with {WinBUGS} for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface with {WinBUGS} at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by {WinBUGS} without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the {WinBUGS} source-code.},

	abstract = {We present a case-study on the utility of graphics cards to perform massively parallel simulation of advanced Monte Carlo methods. Graphics cards, containing multiple Graphics Processing Units {(GPUs),} are self-contained parallel computational devices that can be housed in conventional desktop and laptop computers. For certain classes of Monte Carlo algorithms they offer massively parallel simulation, with the added advantage over conventional distributed multi-core processors that they are cheap, easily accessible, easy to maintain, easy to code, dedicated local devices with low power consumption. On a canonical set of stochastic simulation examples including population-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and Sequential Monte Carlo methods, we find speedups from 35 to 500 fold over conventional single-threaded computer code. Our findings suggest that {GPUs} have the potential to facilitate the growth of statistical modelling into complex data rich domains through the availability of cheap and accessible many-core computation. We believe the speedup we observe should motivate wider use of parallelizable simulation methods and greater methodological attention to their design.},

	abstract = {{BUGS} is a software package for Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling. The software has been instrumental in raising awareness of Bayesian modelling among both academic and commercial communities internationally, and has enjoyed considerable success over its 20-year life span. Despite this, the software has a number of shortcomings and a principal aim of this paper is to provide a balanced critical appraisal, in particular highlighting how various ideas have led to unprecedented flexibility while at the same time producing negative side effects. We also present a historical overview of the {BUGS} project and some future perspectives. Copyright Â© 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
